# Intro

Emby2podcasts convert your emby audiobook into a podcast compatible xml file,so you can use your favoriate podcast app to enjoy your audiobook collection.

## Features

I've using emby for managing my audiobooks for some time, but didn't find a decent app for consuming the content, but I found that podcasts players are perfect for listening,like

1. remembering and syncing play positions among devices.
2. change playback speed.
3. sleep timer.
4. download for offline listens.
5. chapter aware for m4b files.

just unable to sync with the emby library, but after finish one book, you can always mark that book as listened.

recommended using `m4b`,`mp3` and `m4a` files.

## installation

using Docker to run this application.

## configuration

rename `config-example.json` to `config.json`, replace with your own api keys and host.

## podcasts apps

I recommend using the apple podcast app,as for android, pocket casts maybe the app.

## Todo

- [ ] add link to mark the album as listened.
- [x] add diffrent publish date instead of the fixed date to have better sorting.
